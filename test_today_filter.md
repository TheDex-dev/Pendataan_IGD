- [ ] Filter works in combination with other filters (category, status, search)
- [ ] Session persistence works correctly

### 3. JavaScript Functionality
- [ ] Checking the box triggers automatic data refresh
- [ ] Unchecking the box triggers automatic data refresh
- [ ] Filter indicator shows active state when today filter is enabled
- [ ] Search button shows count of active filters

### 4. API Integration

- [ ] API returns filtered results correctly

### 5. Visual Indicators

## Files Modified

1. `/resources/views/dashboard.blade.php` - Added checkbox UI and JavaScript
2. `/app/Http/Controllers/EscortDataController.php` - Added controller logic
3. `/app/Http/Controllers/Api/EscortApi.php` - Added API support
4. `/resources/views/partials/escort-table.blade.php` - Added visual indicator

## Expected Behavior

When "Hari Ini Saja" is checked:
- Only records with created_at = today's date should be displayed
- Blue info bar should appear above the table
- Search button should show active filter count
- AJAX requests should include today_only=1 parameter

When unchecked:
- All records should be displayed (subject to other filters)
- No info bar should appear
- Filter count should adjust accordingly
